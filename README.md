# Stable Diffusion (From Scratch)

This project is a from-scratch implementation of a Stable Diffusion–style
latent diffusion model, including:

- Variational Autoencoder (VAE)
- Diffusion UNet
- Synthetic captioning
- Classifier-Free Guidance
- DDIM sampling

This repo is a learning + research project focused on understanding
diffusion models end-to-end.
